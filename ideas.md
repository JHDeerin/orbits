# Weekly Game Jam 164 Ideas: "Hurl"

-   Endless runner where your leg is injured in a forest and you have to hobble away from baddies/forest fires/etc; collect 2-3 wood pieces by chopping down wood (with the hatchet you conveniently have) to build a catapult, wind it back, and launch yourself!
    -   As you get farther, overcome obstacles like wolves, angry huntsmen, and stairs!
-   "Orbits" combat idea of having a war across interplanetary distances, hurling increasingly large objects at one another
    -   Could upgrade over time to get longer/more accurate trajectory calculator, along with choosing between sending mining bots/sensors to asteroids with your (long cooldown) cannons and shooting actual deadly space projectiles
    -   Fog of war, where you can only see as far as your farthest probe has gone
    -   Probes can build defense turrets on asteroids (can upgrade; fires once every 0.25s, upgrade means each shot has a 2%, 3%, or 4% chance of landing on incoming projectile)
    -   Probes that haven't landed on anything in 60s (of game time) automatically self destruct
        -   Say that probes double as asteroid miners (assume, for gameplay's sake, that resource pool is global)
    -   For solar system generation:
        -   Generates just 2 earth-like planets (where the players are)
            -   Each planet has 1 moon orbiting it
        -   Generates 0-5 other gas giants, each 2-5 times larger than the earth planets; gas giant has at least 2 moons orbiting it (max of 6)
    -   ANOTHER IDEA: Generate the solar system, then let the PLAYERS choose which planet they want to start on (players choose simultaneously; if they both start on the same planet, allow it and let hilarity ensue?)
        -   Players can start on an earth-like planet OR a moon
            -   So, you know the overall map right away, BUT scanners are still needed to find the enemy + to know which asteroids/moons are resource rich (only know what resources an asteroid has )
        -   Maybe have a mechanic where AFTER the players choose their starting locations, you assign resource amounts so that the farther away it is from either player, the more resources there are
            -   Make resources exhaustible except for the earth-like planets? (Means there's a trade-off between starting on earth)
    -   Base cannon mines some starting amount of resources, but scanners/miners are needed to generate more
